## 📄 Project Description

The goal of this project is to apply regression techniques to a Kaggle dataset and evaluate model performance.  
All steps—from data loading to model evaluation—are documented in `Project_final.Rmd`.

The workflow includes:

### ✅ Data Cleaning  
Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and preparing fields for modeling.

### ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis  
- Visual summaries  
- Distribution checks  
- Correlation analysis  
- Identifying important features  

### ✅ Feature Engineering  
Transformations and additional features to improve predictive performance.

### ✅ Regression Modeling  
Evaluation of multiple regression models using R, along with performance metrics and comparisons.

### ✅ Final Results  
The PDF file includes a rendered version of the full analysis and visualizations.
